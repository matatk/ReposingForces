% The ReposingForces API

This is an API for Chess and variants such as [Chess960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960). It is designed to be used by a client web site/app that actually presents UI and causes players to recieve an email when it's their turn to move.

The name is a pun on [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and [Half-Life's 'Opposing Force' expansion pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force).
