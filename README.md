ReposingForces
==============

A Chess API (and, later, web site) for playing with friends via web and email. Almost certainly wheel-reinventing, but this is for personal learning, and I've also not come across many [Chess960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960) 'digital correspondence chess' services.

The name is a pun on [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and [Half-Life's 'Opposing Force' expansion pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force).

Development
-----------

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `make` will generate the HTML API docs; `make open` will generate the HTML docs and open them in a browser
- `make clean` will remove the generated HTML API docs

Note: development is carried out on macOS.
