ReposingForces
==============

A Chess API (and, later, web site) for playing with friends via web and email. Almost certainly wheel-reinventing, but this is for personal learning, and I've also not come across many Chess960 'digital correspondence chess' services.

The name is a pun on [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and [Half-Life's 'Opposing Force' expansion pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force).
