ReposingForces
==============

A Chess API (and, later, web site) for playing with friends via web and
email. Almost certainly wheel-reinventing, but this is for personal
learning, and I've also not come across many Chess960 'digital
correspondence chess' services.

-   `make`, `make all` or `make docs` will build everything (presently
    only the docs).
-   `make open-docs` will open the docs in your default browser
    after building.

The name is a pun on
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
and [Half-Life's 'Opposing Force' expansion
pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force).
